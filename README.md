# Module 19 Challenge

Course materials utilized to complete assignment.

# Background

You are tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so you are also asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network.

# Instructions

Open the starter file in Google Colab and complete the following steps, which are divided into three parts:

## Part 1: Preprocessing

Import the data and view the first five rows. (Given.)

Determine the number of unique values in each column.
### Added print() to format the output to match.

Create y_df with the attrition and department columns.
### Self-explanitory, selected the two columns from the data source.

Create a list of at least 10 column names to use as X data. You can choose any 10 columns youâ€™d like EXCEPT the attrition and department columns.
### Selected the columns matching the starter file.

Create X_df using your selected columns.

Show the data types for X_df.
### and displayed the data types.

Split the data into training and testing sets.
### Used X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test to split data.

Convert your X data to numeric data types however you see fit. Add new code cells as necessary. Make sure to fit any encoders to the training data, and then transform both the training and testing data.

Create a StandardScaler, fit the scaler to the training data, and then transform both the training and testing data.
### Used StandardScaler as per in class course instruction.

Create a OneHotEncoder for the department column, then fit the encoder to the training data and use it to transform both the training and testing data.
### Used OneHotEncoder as per in class course instruction.

Create a OneHotEncoder for the attrition column, then fit the encoder to the training data and use it to transform both the training and testing data.
### Copied Department and changed to Attrition.

## Part 2: Create, Compile, and Train the Model

Find the number of columns in the X training data.

Create the input layer. Do NOT use a sequential model, as there will be two branched output layers.

Create at least two shared layers.
### Use of relu as per course instruction.

Create a branch to predict the department target column. Use one hidden layer and one output layer.
### Set up Department with relu

Create a branch to predict the attrition target column. Use one hidden layer and one output layer.
### Repeated Department with Attrition with relu.

Create the model.

Compile the model.

Summarize the model.
### Created, Compiled, and Summarized the Model.
It did take a couple tries to get matching numbers in the Starter file.

Train the model using the preprocessed data.
### Trained the model as per course instruction examples.

Evaluate the model with the testing data.
### Evaluated the model with testing data.  
I wasn't able to specifically match the starter file, attempting to vary formating.

Print the accuracy for both department and attrition.
### Printed accuracy. 

## Part 3: Summary

Briefly answer the following questions in the space provided:

Is accuracy the best metric to use on this data? Why or why not?
### Accuracy is dependent upon the balance of how many stay or leave, but not why.

What activation functions did you choose for your output layers, and why?
### Converting Yes or No to a 0 or a 1 to aid in calculations.

Can you name a few ways that this model could be improved?
### A number of factors combined can help improve the output and results.
